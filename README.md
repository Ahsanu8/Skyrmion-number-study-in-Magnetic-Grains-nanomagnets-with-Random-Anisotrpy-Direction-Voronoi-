# Skyrmion number study in Magnetic Grains with Random Anisotrpy Direction-Voronoi

This code is to study the magnetic behavior of exchanged coupled magnetic grains with random anisotropy.

This code is used in our research article "Topological phase transitions and Berry-phase hysteresis in exchange-coupled nanomagnets", A. Ullah et. al. Phys. Rev. B 106, 134430 (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.134430). In our article we used this code to explain our experimental results. 

Our supercomputer facility Holland Computing Center - University of Nebraska–Lincoln provides maximum 8-hrs for jupyter notebook sessions. If the time for session increase then the number of grains can be increase along with (x,y,z) dimensions. 

The code is based on Ubermag softwere (https://ubermag.github.io/), (M. Beg, M. Lang and H. Fangohr, “Ubermag: Toward More Effective Micromagnetic Workflows,” in IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, vol. 58, no. 2, pp. 1-5, Feb. 2022, Art no. 7300205, doi: 10.1109/TMAG.2021.3078896).

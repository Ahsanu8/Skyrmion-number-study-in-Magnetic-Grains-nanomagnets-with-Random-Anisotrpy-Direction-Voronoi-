# Magnetic-Grains-with-Random-Anisotrpy-Voronoi-

This code is to study the magnetic behavior of exchanged coupled magnetic grains with random anisotropy. The code is based on Ubermag (https://ubermag.github.io/) and discussed in detail in here (https://github.com/ubermag/help/issues/110).
This code is used in our research articleTopological phase transitions and Berry-phase hysteresis in exchange-coupled nanomagnets Phys. Rev. B 106, 134430 (https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.134430). in our article we used this code to explain our experimental results. 

Our supercomputer facility holland computing at University of Nebraska-lincoln center provides maximum 8hrs for jupyter notebook sessions. If the time for session increase then the number of grains can be increase along with (x,y,z) dimensions.
